random scrapers of crypto/banking/stocks balances/portfolios

All of these are designed thinking of: scrape data and push to [home-assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

For anyone looking for the same, they're plug and play. For the rest, maybe the scraping code is useful.

Check each module for documentation (comments on top) on how to use it.
